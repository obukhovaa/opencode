Provide a detailed but concise summary of our conversation above. Focus on information that would be helpful for continuing the conversation, including what we did, what we're doing, which files we're working on, and what we're going to do next. If you find information related to a specific tool call at the end of conversation, then try to preserve it as much as possible so agent can figure out what parameters have been passed and what response has been given by the tool.
